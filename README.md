# TeamMod
Factorio mod for team play

This mod was inspired by Easy Teams by KaleR. The main updates were to 0.16, fix loading from a save, and overall improve the structure of the code.

Debugging is disabled by default. 'global.DEBUG' is for method debugging while 'global.DEBUG_ALL' is more thorough and includes on_tick debugging. 
Do not use DEBUG_ALL unless absolutely necessary as it can clog the game output logs. 

I do plan on updating this with more features or if bugs are found. 

Enjoy!
