This mod was inspired by Easy Teams by KaleR. The main updates were to 0.16, fix loading from a save, and overall improve the structure of the code.

Updates in 0.1.8 were to keep up with 0.17 release. 
Update to 0.1.9 if having issues with version 0.17.74 of Factorio

Debugging is disabled by default. 'global.DEBUG' is for method debugging while 'global.DEBUG_ALL' is more thorough and includes on_tick debugging. 
Do not use DEBUG_ALL unless absolutely necessary as it can clog the game output logs. 

I do plan on updating this with more features or if bugs are found. 

Enjoy!
